    <h2>Research Proposal</h2>
    <p>
        I am currently working on an innovative project at the University of Adelaide, focusing on Osteoarthritis (OA) Detection using Computer Vision. The project explores the use of Vision Transformers (ViTs) to analyze joint MRI scans for early-stage detection and classification of OA.

As an AI researcher, I am passionate about leveraging Machine Learning and Deep Learning to tackle real-world problems, and this project is a perfect example of how AI can transform the healthcare industry. By improving diagnostic capabilities, weâ€™re aiming to make a significant impact on early detection and treatment.

    <div class="project">
        <h3>ðŸ”¹ Recommendation System</h3>
        <p>This project involves developing a personalized recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. The system analyzes user behavior and recommends items based on similar users using cosine similarity. It also uses item-item similarity matrix with Pearson correlation to recommend similar items. Additionally, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is applied for dimensionality reduction, improving the system's efficiency. The system's performance was evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score for accuracy.</p>

        <h3>ðŸ”¹ Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM</h3>
        <p>This project focuses on developing a time-series prediction model for NIFTY50 stock prices using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). While RNN suffered from the vanishing gradient problem, LSTM performed significantly better by retaining long-term dependencies in the data. The model achieved an RÂ² score of 0.89 with optimized hyperparameters, showcasing its accuracy in predicting stock prices.</p>

        <h3>ðŸ”¹ Question Answering System</h3>
        <p>This project involved building a Question Answering (QA) system using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity. The key steps include preprocessing the text by tokenizing, removing stopwords, and performing lemmatization. The TF-IDF vectorization technique is used to convert the text into a numerical format, and cosine similarity is applied to match the most relevant document to a given query. The system successfully built an efficient QA retrieval system.</p>

        <h3>ðŸ”¹ Breast Cancer Detection</h3>
        <p>This project involved developing a machine learning classification model for predicting breast cancer. The project compared several models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Networks. After evaluation, the model achieved an RÂ² score of 0.93 with precision-recall balancing, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting the presence of breast cancer.</p>

        <h3>ðŸ”¹ Bird Species Classification using CNN: VGG16 vs ResNet-152</h3>
        <p>This project compares the performance of two deep learning architectures, VGG16 and ResNet-152, in classifying bird species. The dataset consists of over 100 bird species, and the models were trained and fine-tuned using techniques like data augmentation, transfer learning, and optimization of hyperparameters. The results showed that ResNet-152 outperforms VGG16 with a final validation accuracy of 96.08% compared to 93.94% for VGG16. This project highlights the significance of selecting the right model based on the nature of the dataset and provides insights into optimizing CNN architectures for image classification tasks.</p>

        <h3>ðŸ”¹ Deep Learning Model Optimization</h3>
        <p>This project focuses on optimizing deep learning models for image classification tasks. It compares a fully connected neural network (FCNN) with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to evaluate the impact of model architecture and learning rate optimization. The CNN model, utilizing convolution and pooling layers, outperformed the FCNN in terms of accuracy, and the learning rate tuning significantly improved both models' convergence speed and performance. The results are visualized through accuracy and loss plots for a clearer comparison of the optimization effects.</p>
